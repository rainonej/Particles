Goal of project

I want to create a particle collision simulator

[+] Initiate Git
[+] Link it to GitHub
[ ] Map out what I want to do
[ ] Write the functions/classes
[ ] Run it and record the data/graph it
[ ] Learn how to use classes


What do I want to do?
I want to be able to do 3d spherical particle collisions in a cube (without angular momentum)
I want to write a (semi)reasonable pi calculation program using this particle collision library

How do I want to organize the data?
Right now I have the particles recorded as dictionaries, because there are too many different types of particles for a class.
But really, only certain types of particles will apear in the same system.
I guess I could create a particle class and have only the essentials on instantiation, and all the optionals default to or none.
